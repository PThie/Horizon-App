# Horizon: Database for Environmental Data

This Shiny App has the aim to construct a database for environmental data. It allows the user for searching the database and adding new data sets based on their meta information. Hence, the database is a collection of data sets characteristics and offers an overview.

It does not provide the data itself as most sources are publicly available and can be directly request/ downloaded from the original data provider.
